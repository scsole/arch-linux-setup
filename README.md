# Automated Arch Linux Post-installation

My Arch Linux post-installation setup scripts.

These scripts install a collection of packages and perform some
configuration. This is not intended to be an Arch Linux [installation
guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) or
installation script.

Some packages and configurations are for my particular system. You should
check the contents of these scripts before running them yourself. You
wouldn't just run any script without knowing what's inside it first, would
you?

These scripts can change frequently.

## Usage

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure as required. Modify packages and
configuration to your hearts content. Then run run your desired scripts.

## Spotted a mistake?

Issues on GitHub are welcome.
