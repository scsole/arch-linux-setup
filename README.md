# Arch Linux Post-installation Setup
My Arch Linux post-installation and setup scripts.

These scripts install a collection of packages and perform some configuration. This is not intended to be an Arch Linux [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) or installation script.

Some of the packages and configuration options are for my particular system. You should check the contents of these scripts before running them yourself. You wouldn't just run any script without knowing what's inside it first, would you?
