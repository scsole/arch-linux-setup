# Warning

These scripts have not been updated for a few months. Updates are inbound soon.

# Automated Arch Linux Post-installation

My Arch Linux post-installation setup scripts.

These scripts install a collection of packages and perform some
configuration. This is not intended to be an Arch Linux [installation
guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) or
installation script.

Some packages and configurations are for my particular system. You should
check the contents of these scripts before running them yourself. You
wouldn't just run any script without knowing what's inside it first, would
you?

These scripts can change frequently.

## Usage

Comment out any unwanted scripts in `00-runall.sh`. Modify packages and
configuration to your hearts content in the remaining files. 


```bash
./00-runall.sh
```
