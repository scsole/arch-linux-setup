# Arch Linux Post-installation Setup

My Arch Linux post-installation setup scripts.

These scripts install a collection of packages and perform some
configuration. This is not intended to be an Arch Linux [installation
guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) or
installation script.

Some packages and configurations are for my particular system. You should
check the contents of these scripts before running them yourself. You
wouldn't just run any script without knowing what's inside it first, would
you?

These scripts might change frequently.

## Usage

```bash
./00-runall.sh
```
