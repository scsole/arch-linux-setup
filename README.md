# Arch Linux Post-installation Setup
My post-installation Arch Linux setup scripts.

These scripts install my preferred packages and configure the system. This is not intended to be an Arch Linux [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) or installation script.

Some of the packages and configuration options are for my particular system. You should check everything before running these scripts yourself. (You wouldn't run any script without knowing what's inside it first, would you?)
